### Credit where credit is due

Big thank you to [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) for building the groundwork for this

Big thanks as well to [rohanliston](https://github.com/rohanliston) for porting this to Linux and providing build files

We're gonna make... something cool with this. I don't know what that thing will be.
